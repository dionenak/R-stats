## 1. Pilot_study_analysis
Dataset from a pilot within-subjects study.
We want to plan a research study about the association between the time of the day and the levels of peopleâ€™s statistical skills

The dataset from the pilot study contained the following variables
- Participant ID (pp_code)
- Gender (f = female; m = male)
- Age (in years)
- Time of day (morning or evening)
- The score on a statistics skills test (the variable is called "score;" this score has theoretical values ranging between 0 and 100, with higher numbers indicating better skills)

Analysis includes: inspection, removal of NAs, visualization of the dependent variable distribution, t-test and effect size calculations.

## 2. Multiple_regression_analysis
To test research questions involving moderation hypotheses.
Inspect univariate distributions and bivariate associations, perform a multiple linear regression with two- and three-way interactions.

The data set contained these variables:

- gender		participant sex (males = 0; females =1)
- sperform	social performance (0 to 25, with higher scores indicating better performance)
- sskills		social skills (1 = unskilled to 5 = very skilled)
- scomplex	social complexity (1 = low complexity to 5 = high complexity)
- sIQ		social intelligence (1 = low intelligence to 5 = high intelligence)

We had to test gender differences, the moderation of social skills on association between social complexity and performance
as well as the moderation of gender and social intelligence on association between social skills and social complexity.

The script includes the preliminary analysis (part A) and the multiple regression analysis (part B).
