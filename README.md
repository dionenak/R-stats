## 1. Pilot_study_analysis
Dataset from a pilot within-subjects study.
We want to plan a research study about the association between the time of the day and the levels of peopleâ€™s statistical skills

The dataset from the pilot study contained the following variables
- Participant ID (pp_code)
- Gender (f = female; m = male)
- Age (in years)
- Time of day (morning or evening)
- The score on a statistics skills test (the variable is called "score;" this score has theoretical values ranging between 0 and 100, with higher numbers indicating better skills)

Analysis includes: inspection, removal of NAs, visualization of the dependent variable distribution, t-test and effect size calculations.
